## Why is this folder here?
It contains all the modules that are or may be useful in other apps too.

## So client-side libraries are also here and symlinked to the public folder? Why, on earth would you do something like that?
At any time, the difference between a client and server script may be very clear. However, a future version of this app may very well do server-side form parsing too, blurring this distinction. Besides, the repo is cleaner this way!

## Grrr.... Where are the instructions on what the symlink and where to?
There aren't any. Grunt takes care of this (dummy).
